<h3>Viewing Method and Experience</h3>
	<p> One of the key differences between print and web design is the way in which people view them, which in turn affects their experience of the design. 
		For example, holding a physical printed copy in your hand is an entirely different experience to viewing something digitally on screen. To this end, the two separate mediums - print and web design - engage users senses in very different ways. With the ability to physically turn pages, write notes and highlight passages print design adds a tactile dimension which can also include texture, shape and printing finishes such as embossing and screenprinting.
		While the digital world is still finding ways to replace these sensroy experiences, the web adds its own sensory dimension with the possibility of audio and video elements and other interactive options such as animated illustrations.Therefore we see neither print or web are inferior to one another, but rather each has its own way of delivering a experience to the user that engages successfully with their senses. 
		Although studies have shown that we retain knowledge and expereince better through physical interaction therefore some might argue print design has an advantage over digital, the web is fast catching up with the alternative possiblities for interaction which it offers.  
	</p>
<h3>Static vs. Interactive</h3>
	<p>This seems an all too obvious difference between print and web design. The former is not going to change once the design is printed, (unless re-printed), while the latter is intentionally created to change regularly if necessary. This allows for redesign at any given point. 
	For that reason, web designers have the additional task of designing for ongoing fucntionality. Interactive features must also be carefully considered and work efficiently to successfully engage the user at all times as they are required to respond with the click of buttons for example.
	</p> 
<h3>Usability and Navigation</h3>
	<p>Print design is kept within the physical size and shape of the surface or object and mostly navigation is limited to flipping or unfolding a page. To this end, print design is kept simple and straigthforward with little confusion about how to navigate from one topic to the next. 
	Web design on the other hand is not so basic. Users encounter different layouts and need a way to find content they are looking for, which is the role of menus. They are crucial for website navigation and must be located where it is easy for viewers to find in order for the website to fully function. 
	To add to this, web designers need to consider how the design appears on different devices which may present varying screen sizes. In contrast a printed book or magazine does not offer or adapt to various viewing methods. Further, thought must be given to how layouts and designs will change when viewers scroll and zoom in or out. Web design must also consider compatability with the need to display and operate in different browsers. In this sense, web design has a more complex dimension to it. 
	Print design does not require these additional features and navigational considerations to the same extent, simply because of the form it takes. 
	Therefore we see how print and web design must both take into account readibility to enhance user experience, but how they go about it and best cater to their respective formats is entirely different.  
	</p>
<h3>Arrangement of Content</h3>
	<p>In print design, all information must be presented within the constraints of the printing surface. Printed material often needs to meet certain standards using margins and bleeds. 
		On the other hand, the web has unlimited flexiblity to organize, arrange and filter information. The layout requirements are adaptable because of the need to display information suited for different viewing methods, such as web and mobile.
		Since different browsers can change a web designer's original layout, the arrangement of the content requires meticulous testing with different operating systems and browsers to ensure optimum functionality. 
		</p> 
<h3>Design Space and Size</h3>
		<p>The size of the printing surface is crucial in print design, which includes considering what design elements will be used and the amount and size of text, amongst others. While projects often have set sizes, sizes are almost unlimited as paper and printing surfaces can be cut to any size or shape. 
			Size is more of an abstract element in web design. The size that the design is viewed at is limited to the certain number of devices that are now available, with a particular focus on smartphones since people are increasingly browsing the web in a more mobile direction.The content, required to be scaled to fit any device in this way is known as adaptability.

<h3>Resolution</h3>
		<p> Resolution is what determines image quality. 
			<br />
			Resolution 	in terms of the printing process is to do with DPI.
			<br />
			<dt> DPI </dt>
			<dd>the density of the dots of ink printed on an inch of printing surface</dd>
			<br />
		 	DPI is not to do with the size of a print but is specifically to do with how ink is printed on a surface, therefore it is important to note it is irrelevant for web design. 
		 	<br />
			Resolution in terms of digital design is to do with PPI.
			<br />
			<dt> PPI </dt>
			<dd>the number of pixels in an inch of screen space.</dd>
			<br /> 
			The quality is improved the more pixels there are per inch making the image clearer and sharper. Note: a digital image is measured in pixels while a print is measured in inches or centimetres.  
			When a digital image is displayed online at a size larger than its original pixel dimensions this is when pixelation occurs which is a loss of quality due to blurriness or distortion. 
			Confusion can be caused when preparing a digital image for printing. For this reason it is important to recognise the relationship between PPI and print size - a higher PPI (pixels per inch) will condense or reduce the physical size of a print but increase its quality. Designers therefore need to set the PPI to ensure an adequate combination of size and quality.

<h3>File Formats and Types</h3>
	<p><i>Common file types:</i>
	<h4>Print and Web</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>JPEG - default file format on many digital cameras</li>
		<li>PDF - preserves the original content and appearance of a file</li>
		<li>EPS - saving vector graphics, not always readable on PCs.</li>
		<li>PNG - high image quality</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Print Only</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>TIFF - high image quality and large file sizes, often used for final handover to a printer.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>Web Only</h4>
		<ul>
		<li>GIF: supports graphics deautring animation. </li>
		<li>SVG: vector format scaled up or down. </li>
		</ul>

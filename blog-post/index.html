<h3>Viewing Method and Experience</h3>
	<p> One of the key differences between print and web design is the way in which people view them, which in turn affects their experience of the design. 
		For example, holding a physical printed copy in your hand is an entirely different experience to viewing something digitally on screen. To this end, the two separate mediums - print and web design - engage users senses in very different ways. With the ability to physically turn pages, write notes and highlight passages print design adds a tactile dimension which can also include texture, shape and printing finishes such as embossing and screenprinting.
		While the digital world is still finding ways to replace these sensroy experiences, the web adds its own sensory dimension with the possibility of audio and video elements and other interactive options such as animated illustrations.Therefore we see neither print or web are inferior to one another, but rather each has its own way of delivering a experience to the user that engages successfully with their senses. 
		Although studies have shown that we retain knowledge and expereince better through physical interaction therefore some might argue print design has an advantage over digital, the web is fast catching up with the alternative possiblities for interaction which it offers.

<h3>Static vs. Interactive</h3>
	<p>This seems an all too obvious difference between print and web design. The former is not going to change once the design is printed, (unless re-printed), while the latter is intentionally created to change regularly if necessary. This allows for redesign at any given point. 
	For that reason, web designers have the additional task of designing for ongoing fucntionality. Interactive features must also be carefully considered and work efficiently to successfully engage the user at all times as they are required to respond with the click of buttons for example.

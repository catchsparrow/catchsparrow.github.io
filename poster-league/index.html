		Poster League was initially started to bring artists of all sorts, beginner to professional, together in order to learn, inspire, and share ideas with one another. To form a community of passionate individuals who purely wish to create some truly beautiful artwork. If we accidently take over the world while on this destined course â€” well, that would be pretty all right too. At least it will be a group of friends ruling the planet.
